 ## Project Overview

**Goal: Predict closing prices using historical stock data**

**Models Trained:**

      Linear Regression (baseline)

      Random Forest

      LSTM

      GRU (best performer)

      CNN-LSTM

 **Key Results**

   *Model*     ,    *RMSE*

    Random Forest , 0.00035
    LSTM , 0.2246
    GRU , 0.1519
    CNN-LSTM , 0.2469

GRU achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE.
